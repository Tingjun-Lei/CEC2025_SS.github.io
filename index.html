    <h2 id="Objectives">Objectives of Special Session</h2>
    <p>
	Bio-inspired intelligence fused with evolutionary computation is a powerful branch of computational intelligence, increasingly significant for robotics. Autonomous robotics and the vehicle industry, both essential to our economy and society, are set to benefit from these hybrid approaches. Evolutionary computation, enhanced by biologically inspired intelligence techniques, such as artificial immune systems, reinforcement learning with evolutionary strategies, and evolutionary multi-objective optimization draws insights from natural systems to address real-world challenges in robotics and vehicle systems.
    </p>
    <p>
	Research and development in bio-inspired systems integrated with evolutionary computation for robotic applications have grown worldwide. Recently, evolutionary computation techniques have been successfully integrated with bio-inspired algorithms, encompassing emerging areas like bio-inspired evolutionary robotics, brain-inspired neuro-evolution robotics, and swarm intelligence-based robotics. These approaches are applied to various computational aspects, such as machine vision, pattern recognition, motion control, motion planning, sensor-motor coordination, and learning in biological systems for robot and vehicle systems.
    </p>
	<p>
This special session aims to showcase and advance emerging research, development, and applications in bio-inspired algorithms within evolutionary computation for robotics and autonomous systems, including autonomous robots, unmanned underwater vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles. We invite contributions that explore new techniques and applications in this dynamic and evolving field.
